The recent spate of student suicides in Kota has once again brought into sharp focus the immense pressure young minds are subjected to while preparing for competitive exams like IIT JEE and NEET. The dream of securing a coveted seat in these prestigious institutions has transformed into a high-stakes gamble, where failure often leads to devastating consequences. The cutthroat competition, coupled with unrealistic expectations from parents and society, has created an environment of intense stress and anxiety among students.

The pursuit of excellence is commendable, but at what cost? The obsession with achieving top ranks has overshadowed the importance of holistic development and mental well-being. The education system, instead of fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills, has become a relentless pursuit of numerical targets. Students are trapped in a vicious cycle of coaching classes, endless tests, and a constant fear of falling behind. This hyper-competitive atmosphere is not conducive to nurturing young minds and is taking a toll on their mental health.

It is imperative to re-evaluate our approach to education. The focus should shift from mere academic achievements to cultivating well-rounded individuals with strong values and a healthy mindset. Schools and coaching institutes must prioritize mental health support and create a supportive learning environment. Parents and society must play their part by setting realistic expectations and encouraging students to pursue their passions beyond academics. Only then can we hope to alleviate the immense pressure on our young generation and prevent such tragic incidents from recurring.
